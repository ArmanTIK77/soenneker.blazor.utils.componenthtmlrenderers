## 📄 What Is This?

This software lets you run a Blazor component renderer without opening a browser window. If you’ve ever wanted to turn Blazor components into HTML code that you can use anywhere, this tool does it quietly in the background. It works on computers running Microsoft Windows or any system that supports .NET applications.

Blazor is a Microsoft technology to build web apps using C#. Normally, you need a browser to see what your Blazor components look like. This program skips the browser. It renders components directly to HTML text for other uses, like reports, emails, or static web pages.

## 🧩 Key Features

- Runs without showing any windows or interfaces.
- Converts Blazor components into pure HTML code.
- Supports the latest Blazor and .NET versions.
- Uses reflection to handle complex components.
- Lightweight and easy to include in your projects that use .NET.
- Generates static HTML that you can save or send anywhere.
